Chuckling through a 15-minute stand-up comedy routine can burn between 10 and 40 calories. And this feel-good activity releases a feel-good hormone called serotonin that could reduce appetite.  Hide Caption 1 of 10     10 photos: 10 ways to burn calories without stepping foot in the gym  Lose the belly dance &ndash; Whether you love the disco or can only tolerate an occasional slow dance at weddings, dancing has major weight loss potential. Jamming out with friends at a party can burn between 450 and 600 calories depending on how vigorously you get down. Even swaying at a concert for an hour can counter the effects of that small 230-calorie order of McDonald's French fries you might be tempted to eat on the way home.  Hide Caption 2 of 10     10 photos: 10 ways to burn calories without stepping foot in the gym  Hot and less heavy &ndash; Sex is one of the best workouts outside the gym. For those who can make it last 30 minutes, intercourse can burn about 160 calories. The same amount of foreplay expends about 55 calories. Hide Caption 3 of 10     10 photos: 10 ways to burn calories without stepping foot in the gym  Shop till you drop the pounds &ndash; When rifling through racks of clothes or bins of school supplies, know that an hour of shopping can burn about 180 calories. And if you go grocery shopping for that amount of time, all the heavy lifting can help you burn closer to 260 calories. Just make sure to avoid "shopping and eating at the same time," Lofton said.  Hide Caption 4 of 10     10 photos: 10 ways to burn calories without stepping foot in the gym  Work it off &ndash; For overweight women and men, standing instead of sitting at the desk burns about two more calories a minute and can lead to a weight loss of 16 to 20 pounds a year, according to Mira Rasmussen, an exercise physiologist at the Obesity Action Coalition, an obesity advocacy group. You can also try pacing the office; a total of two hours a week can lead to a weight reduction of about 10 pounds a year, Rasmussen estimated. Hide Caption 5 of 10     10 photos: 10 ways to burn calories without stepping foot in the gym  At the top of your lungs &ndash; Don't be shy about wailing along to your favorite tunes, at least in the privacy of your own home or car. Singing can burn about 136 calories. Bonus if you can also dance to your favorite tunes.  Hide Caption 6 of 10     10 photos: 10 ways to burn calories without stepping foot in the gym  Cut the fat &ndash; Cooking may seem like a hassle, but 30 minutes in the kitchen can burn about 100 calories. Sure, it would be much easier to pick up dinner on the way home, but "you don't get the benefits of chopping and moving around," Lofton said. Hide Caption 7 of 10     10 photos: 10 ways to burn calories without stepping foot in the gym  Shiver me thinner &ndash; You may hate the subzero temperatures in your office but that uncontrollable shivering is probably keeping you from gaining weight. A recent small study found that people burned 438 more calories in a room that was 60 degrees than in an 81-degree room. At that rate, you could burn about 18 calories in an hour just by being a tad chilly. Hide Caption 8 of 10     10 photos: 10 ways to burn calories without stepping foot in the gym  Lean sweep &ndash; The house won't clean itself, so you might as well buckle down and burn some calories. For an average sized man, it takes about 110 calories to do a half hour's worth of sweeping or vacuuming. For an average-sized woman, it takes about 95 calories.  Hide Caption 9 of 10     10 photos: 10 ways to burn calories without stepping foot in the gym  Mental burn &ndash; When you really put your mind to it, you can burn an additional 1.5 calories a minute. The brain, an energy suck compared to the rest of the body's organs, already uses up 20% of the calories you go through in a day. But demanding more of those already active neurons -- say by focusing on a crossword puzzle or Rubik's Cube -- can ramp up the amount of energy the brain burns through. Hide Caption 10 of 10          Story highlights You burn more calories running outside than on a treadmill, but burn fewer on real bike than a stationary one You are more prone to injury on a treadmill than running outside, but a stationary bike is safer than a real one   Dr. Tom Flaherty is a medical doctor, triathlete and fitness fanatic who lives in New York City.  (CNN) It's that time of year when the allure of a warm gym with comforting TV screens and a post-workout sauna might still seem appealing. But as spring blossoms and the outdoors calls, the question looms: Is it better to exercise indoors or out? There are pros and cons for both. Indoor workouts are cozy and dry and sometimes safer; outdoor workouts are almost always free and often right on your doorstep. But which is better for your overall health and fitness?   CNN tested the most popular indoor and outdoor exercises, measuring calories burned, heart rate (exercise intensity), likelihood of injury and how they rank on the all-important fun scale.    Running outdoors vs indoors (treadmill)  Calories burned per hour: Outdoors was 970. Indoors was 661. Winner: Outdoors.  Read More  Average heart rate: Outdoors was 163. Indoors was 129. Winner: Outdoors.     Dave Goldberg&#39;s death highlights dangers of treadmills  Risk of injury: You are more likely to pick up an injury running on a treadmill than in the great outdoors. On the treadmill you repeat virtually the same running motion every stride, which increases your risk for an overuse injury, like tendinitis. Outside, the more corrections you have to make for running over curbs, up and down hills, and over rough ground, the more you are forced to use different muscles and tendons, so you're less likely to damage them. The treadmill is the single most dangerous piece of exercise equipment, accounting for 24,400 emergency room visits in 2014, according to the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission . Although the risk of falling on a treadmill is pretty low, if you do fall, the consequences can be quite severe. Winner: Outdoors. Fun scale: Studies show that runners who run outside report increased feelings of well-being and revitalization, and decreased feelings of depression, stress and anxiety. Those feelings might be the result of a connection with nature -- the sun, wind, mountains, trees and so on. Or they could be due to the fact that you're more likely to run outdoors with a running partner or group, and develop a human connection, than if you run on a treadmill inside by yourself. The gym can be a great place to meet up and work out with friends too, but most people run solo indoors, which can be quite monotonous, and slightly sad when the realization sinks in that you're running but not actually going anywhere on a treadmill. Winner: Outdoors. Overall winner: Outdoors.    Cycling outdoors vs indoors (stationary bike)  Calories burned per hour: Outdoors was 570. Indoors was 761. Winner: Indoors. Average heart rate: Outdoors was 119. Indoors was 140. Winner: Indoors. Risk of injury: Risk of the most common cycling injuries, such as Achilles tendinitis, patellar (knee) tendinitis and saddle sores (a sore butt from being on the seat for too long) is roughly the same. But the risk of falling off a stationary bike and injuring yourself is virtually zero. If you fall off your bike outdoors, the bones you're most likely to break are the clavicle (collar bone) and the scaphoid bone (one of the bones in the wrist). Winner: Indoors. Fun scale: Biking outside is a great activity to do with friends, and being in a group makes the ride safer, if you were to fall. A recent study published in Psychology of Sport and Exercise found that our friends' exercise habits have a positive impact on our own exercise habits . So you're more likely to push yourself and have a better workout if you buddy up. In a similar way, a spinning class lets your feed off other people's energy in the studio and work harder as a result. New research suggests that when we work out in groups, we release more endorphins -- the "happy chemicals" responsible for a runner's high, and feelings of fondness toward others -- because you bond as a group.

So, for running, if you want to get the best bang for your health buck before the summer, it pays to get the right gear for the weather, brave the morning chill, and head outside. For cycling, don't feel guilty if you stay inside on the stationary bike until the weather perks up. But when summer finally arrives, I still recommend cycling outdoors. It's good for the soul, and your vitamin D levels. Just ride safe and always wear a helmet.
