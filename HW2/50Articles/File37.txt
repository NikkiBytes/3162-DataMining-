Chuckling through a 15-minute stand-up comedy routine can burn between 10 and 40 calories. And this feel-good activity releases a feel-good hormone called serotonin that could reduce appetite.

Jamming out with friends at a party can burn between 450 and 600 calories depending on how vigorously you get down. Even swaying at a concert for an hour can counter the effects of that small 230-calorie order of McDonald's French fries you might be tempted to eat on the way home.  Hide Caption 2 of 10     10 photos: 10 ways to burn calories without stepping foot in the gym  Hot and less heavy &ndash; Sex is one of the best workouts outside the gym. For those who can make it last 30 minutes, intercourse can burn about 160 calories. The same amount of foreplay expends about 55 calories. Hide Caption 3 of 10     10 photos: 10 ways to burn calories without stepping foot in the gym  Shop till you drop the pounds &ndash; When rifling through racks of clothes or bins of school supplies, know that an hour of shopping can burn about 180 calories. And if you go grocery shopping for that amount of time, all the heavy lifting can help you burn closer to 260 calories. Just make sure to avoid "shopping and eating at the same time," Lofton said.  Hide Caption 4 of 10     10 photos: 10 ways to burn calories without stepping foot in the gym  Work it off &ndash; For overweight women and men, standing instead of sitting at the desk burns about two more calories a minute and can lead to a weight loss of 16 to 20 pounds a year, according to Mira Rasmussen, an exercise physiologist at the Obesity Action Coalition, an obesity advocacy group. You can also try pacing the office; a total of two hours a week can lead to a weight reduction of about 10 pounds a year, Rasmussen estimated. Hide Caption 5 of 10     10 photos: 10 ways to burn calories without stepping foot in the gym  At the top of your lungs &ndash; Don't be shy about wailing along to your favorite tunes, at least in the privacy of your own home or car. Singing can burn about 136 calories. Bonus if you can also dance to your favorite tunes.  Hide Caption 6 of 10     10 photos: 10 ways to burn calories without stepping foot in the gym  Cut the fat &ndash; Cooking may seem like a hassle, but 30 minutes in the kitchen can burn about 100 calories. Sure, it would be much easier to pick up dinner on the way home, but "you don't get the benefits of chopping and moving around," Lofton said. Hide Caption 7 of 10     10 photos: 10 ways to burn calories without stepping foot in the gym  Shiver me thinner &ndash; You may hate the subzero temperatures in your office but that uncontrollable shivering is probably keeping you from gaining weight. A recent small study found that people burned 438 more calories in a room that was 60 degrees than in an 81-degree room. At that rate, you could burn about 18 calories in an hour just by being a tad chilly. Hide Caption 8 of 10     10 photos: 10 ways to burn calories without stepping foot in the gym  Lean sweep &ndash; The house won't clean itself, so you might as well buckle down and burn some calories. For an average sized man, it takes about 110 calories to do a half hour's worth of sweeping or vacuuming. For an average-sized woman, it takes about 95 calories.  Hide Caption 9 of 10     10 photos: 10 ways to burn calories without stepping foot in the gym  Mental burn &ndash; When you really put your mind to it, you can burn an additional 1.5 calories a minute. The brain, an energy suck compared to the rest of the body's organs, already uses up 20% of the calories you go through in a day. But demanding more of those already active neurons -- say by focusing on a crossword puzzle or Rubik's Cube -- can ramp up the amount of energy the brain burns through. Hide Caption 10 of 10          Story highlights Repetitive activities that put your hands to work can help relieve stress by getting you out of your head Gardening is better than other leisure activities for fighting stress and lowering your risk of dementia Taking time off from work can reduce your risk of heart attack and depression   When it comes to your health, you already know how important it is to eat well and stay active. But other hobbies and lifestyle changes—that have nothing to do with diet or exercise—can also offer a big payoff for your wellbeing. Try incorporating a few of these activities into your routine to benefit from reduced stress levels, lesser risk of certain diseases, lower blood pressure, and much more. RELATED: 25 Scientifically Proven Ways to Be a Happier Person   1. Knitting and crocheting It might be time to pick up that half-finished crochet project again. Repetitive activities that put your hands to work can help relieve stress by getting you out of your head. Plus, a 2013 survey of 3,500 knitters uncovered a link between knitting and cognitive function: the more people knitted, the better brain function they had. 2. Volunteering  Read More  That warm, fuzzy feeling you get after volunteering at the local soup kitchen or donating to a good cause has tangible health perks. Giving back to others has been linked to lower blood pressure, reduced stress, and even a longer lifespan. In a recent study published in the American Journal of Public Health, researchers discovered that people who displayed acts of generosity seemed to be protected against stress. Those who didn't give back as frequently during the study had a 30% higher risk of dying after a stressful life event. Generosity also boosts your mood in the short term: A 2007 study found that donating money activates the same pleasure-related centers in the brain as spending it does.

Playing with your pet     13 ways to exercise with your dog  Good news for those with furry friends: Caring for a pet has been shown to decrease blood pressure, cholesterol levels, triglyceride levels, and reduce feelings of loneliness, according to the CDC. And dog owners might experience additional benefits, since walking your pup is a good form of exercise and can prevent weight gain. According to a 2011 U.S. National Institutes of Health-funded study of 2,000 adults, people who regularly walked their dogs were more physically active and less likely to be obese than those who did not. 4. Cooking     Michael Pollan really wants you to cook  It should come as no surprise that a home-cooked meal is healthier than one you'd get at a restaurant, where dishes are often prepared with lots of salt, butter, and oil. According to a 2014 study, people who regularly eat at home consume about 130 fewer calories daily than those who do not. And teaching children how to cook healthy meals with fresh ingredients has been shown to help curb obesity. RELATED: How to Prep Once and Eat Healthy All Week 5. Gardening Growing your own fruits, veggies, and herbs does more than provide fresh bounty for the dinner table. Studies have shown that gardening is better than other leisure activities for fighting stress. It might improve depression symptoms, too, since the sights and smells of a garden promote relaxation. Research also suggests that gardening can lower your risk of developing dementia. In two different studies, people in their 60s and 70s who regularly gardened had a 36% and 47% lower risk of developing dementia than non-gardeners did. You shouldn't discount the physical activity gardening entails, either: According to a 2013 study in the American Journal of Health Promotion, short stretches of moderate "lifestyle" activities such as gardening can be just as beneficial as a trip to the gym. 6. Meditation     Can meditation banish back pain?  There's a reason why meditation has been around for thousands of years. The ancient practice has been linked to a slew of health benefits, including improved digestion, lowered blood pressure, reduced stress-induced inflammation, and the release of mood-boosting chemicals like serotonin and dopamine. Meditation can also help ease pain. In a recent study published in the Journal of Neuroscience, researchers concluded that meditation could alleviate pain intensity by 27% and emotional pain by 44%. Shockingly, that's more than the opioid morphine, which reduces physical pain by 22%. RELATED: 6 Healthy Habits All Women Share 7. Coloring     Why adult coloring books are good for you  As with knitting, crafty projects such as coloring, drawing, or painting can have powerful mental health benefits. Studies have shown that art therapy can help you relax and ease stress and anxiety. One study published in Western Journal of Medicine concluded that art therapy might help treat depression in troubled adolescents, who can use it as a way to express their feelings. Another study found that creative projects like art therapy, music, and expressive writing could have healing benefits. 8. Traveling  Join the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter .  Let this be the push you needed to book that trip abroad: Taking time off from work (yes, that means not checking your email) can reduce your risk of heart attack and depression. According to a 2010 study in the journal Psychosomatic Medicine, engaging in leisure activities such as time off and travel can lower blood pressure and stress hormones. Planning to visit one of the great wonders of the world? Even better. Recent research suggests that people who regularly experience feelings of awe might have reduced risk of getting heart disease or cancer.
