Hide Caption 6 of 6         Story highlights The research challenges the paradigm that replacing saturated fats with unsaturated fats helps reduce the risk of heart disease Experts recommend that consumers continue to replace butter with oils but to use a variety of oils to maximize the health benefits    (CNN) Diets rich in vegetable oils and low in saturated fat might not be all they are cracked up to be in terms of heart health, according to new research. Just about every diet recommends reducing saturated fats, such as butter and cheese, and replacing them with unsaturated fats, such as vegetable oil and fatty fish. The 2015 dietary guidelines advise limiting saturated fats to no more than 10% of daily calories.  There have been only a few studies comparing these two types of fat head-to-head between groups of people eating otherwise similar diets. In the new study , researchers revisited data from a trial carried out from 1968 to 1973 that involved more than 9,000 adults living in a nursing home or mental hospitals in Minnesota. About half the participants received diets that contained 18.5% saturated fat and 5% unsaturated fat, based on total calories, and the other half got diets that were 9% saturated fat and 13% unsaturated fat. In the unsaturated fat diet, the researchers increased the level of linolenic acid, an omega-6 polyunsaturated fat, found in margarine and oils such as corn and soybean. Researchers found, not surprisingly, that the group that got the diet rich in linolenic acid had lower cholesterol, by about 13%, than the saturated fat diet group. For this analysis, the researchers only included the 2,403 participants who were on one of the two diets for at least a year.         JUST WATCHED Is saturated fat bad for you?

Generally, a total cholesterol level above 200 mg/dL is considered high and could increase the risk for heart disease. However the opposite effect was seen in this study; every decrease in total cholesterol by 30 mg/dL was associated with a 22% increase in death rate. A total of 517 of the 2,403 participants died during the follow-up period of the study, which was three years on average. "This study is less of one showing harm (associated with a diet rich in unsaturated fat), and more of one saying it is surprising how little evidence there is and what there is does not show benefit," said Dr. Christopher E. Ramsden, a medical investigator at the National Institutes of Health and lead author of the study , which was published Tuesday in the journal the BMJ. No reason to change the dietary guidelines "The results should not alter current dietary guidelines that emphasize healthy sources of polyunsaturated fats such as olive oil and other vegetables, nuts, seeds, avocado, fish and seafood in the context of a healthy dietary pattern," said Dr. Frank Hu, professor of nutrition and epidemiology at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health and one of the committee members that prepared the advisory report for the 2015 dietary guidelines. These guidelines describe three healthy dietary patterns -- American, Mediterranean and vegetarian -- that consumers can choose from. The current study has several flaws that keep it from being a strong case against polyunsaturated fats, Hu said. For one, the average amount of time people were on the diet was just over a year, which he said is not long enough to have an effect on heart health. For another, a "cholesterol paradox" could be at play here, Hu said, because people who are the most frail or unhealthy tend to have lower cholesterol, as well as decreases in blood pressure and body weight. Frailty or other health conditions could have thus explained the association with higher death rates, and not the lower cholesterol and unsaturated fat diet.      13 photos: The history of trans fat     13 photos: The history of trans fat  The Food and Drug Administration recently took a step toward eliminating most trans fat from our food. The government agency said it has made a preliminary determination that a major source of trans fats -- partially hydrogenated oils -- is no longer "generally recognized as safe." If the FDA's decision is finalized, partially hydrogenated oils will become food additives that could no longer be used without approval.

His research detailed the way nickel could be used as a catalyst to create chemical reactions between hydrogen molecules and other compounds. This laid the groundwork for the creation of hydrogenated oils. Hide Caption 2 of 13     13 photos: The history of trans fat  How would you like to be known as the scientist who discovered "fat hardening"? Wilhelm Normann was awarded a patent in 1903 for the "Process for the Conversion of Unsaturated Fatty Acids or Their Glycerides into Saturated Compounds." Basically, Normann figured out how to turn liquid oils into a thicker, firmer substance through hydrogenation. This solid fat was less likely to spoil and cheaper to produce and transport.

The vegetable shortening was the first manufactured food product to contain trans fat.  Hide Caption 4 of 13     13 photos: The history of trans fat  The Kaltman family tries to sell as much butter as possible at their New York dairy store in 1943 before a government deadline to freeze sales. During World War II, the federal government rationed butter in an attempt to control supply and demand while manufacturing plants were being used to support the war effort. As a result, margarine, which contains trans fat, grew in popularity.  Hide Caption 5 of 13     13 photos: The history of trans fat  In 1957, the American Heart Association started encouraging people to limit fat in their diets in an effort to lower the risk of heart disease. Hide Caption 6 of 13     13 photos: The history of trans fat  As the popularity of fast-food restaurants grew, so did Americans' consumption of fat, calories and salt. In 1984, advocacy groups started campaigning to get saturated fat removed from fast-food chains. As a result, more restaurants began using partially hydrogenated oils that contained trans fat.  Hide Caption 7 of 13     13 photos: The history of trans fat  Advocacy groups switched their focus to banning trans fats in the early 1990s after several scientific studies showed that they increased the risk of coronary heart disease. By this time, Americans' trans fat intake averaged 4% to 7% of calories from fat, according to the Harvard School of Public Health .  Hide Caption 8 of 13     13 photos: The history of trans fat  In 2004, Denmark made it illegal (PDF) for any food to have more than 2% trans fats. Offenders can face hefty fines or even prison terms. Other countries are also working to reduce trans fat in the food supply. Policies in Brazil, Costa Rica, the Netherlands and South Korea have proved effective over the past two decades, the World Health Organization says. The WHO has called for eliminating trans fat from the global food supply. Hide Caption 9 of 13     13 photos: The history of trans fat  In 2006, the FDA implemented a rule requiring manufacturers to list trans fat on nutrition labels. Under current regulations , companies can claim that their food has zero grams of trans fat if the it contains less than 0.5 grams of trans fat per serving. Consumers can check the ingredient list for "partially hydrogenated oil" to see whether there is a small amount of trans fat present.  Hide Caption 10 of 13     13 photos: The history of trans fat  In 2007, New York became the first city to ban the use of partially hydrogenated vegetable oils and spreads in restaurants. A five-year follow-up study showed that the average trans fat content of New York customers' meals dropped from about 3 grams to 0.5 grams. The ban encouraged food companies across the country to remove trans fat from their products.  Hide Caption 11 of 13     13 photos: The history of trans fat  Even state fairs jumped on board , many asking vendors to cook summer favorites -- like these deep-fried Milky Ways at the Indiana State Fair -- in trans fat-free oils.  Hide Caption 12 of 13     13 photos: The history of trans fat  In 2012, first lady Michelle Obama and Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack announced guidelines for school lunches that will implement calorie caps and severely limit trans fat. Trans fat intake among American consumers has decreased from 4.6 grams per day in 2003 to about a gram a day in 2012, according to the FDA. However, "current intake remains a significant public health concern," FDA Commissioner Margaret Hamburg said this week in a written statement.  Hide Caption 13 of 13        Other research supports the heart benefits of unsaturated fats, including a 1979 study of 676 middle-aged men in mental health hospitals in Finland. One hospital served diets rich in vegetable oils whereas the control hospital served diets rich in milk and butter. After six years on the diets, the men in the unsaturated fat group had lower cholesterol as well as 50% lower rates of heart disease and death. In addition, an analysis of eight randomized controlled trials , including the Minnesota and the Finnish studies, concluded that consuming polyunsaturated fats, including omega-3 and omega-6 fats, instead of saturated fats reduced the overall rate of heart disease by 19%. However, Ramsden and his colleagues carried out their own analysis of randomized controlled trials as part of the new study and arrived at a different conclusion. They found neither a significant benefit nor a significant harm to replacing saturated fats with polyunsaturated fats. Their analysis only looked at five trials and did not include the Finnish study because it separated the participants into different diets based on their hospital, Ramsden said. The type of unsaturated fat matters      9 photos:      9 photos:  The Western diet is spreading across the world.

Hide Caption 9 of 9       There could be several reasons why the unsaturated fat diet in the study might not really be responsible for the increased risk of death, including the cholesterol paradox, according to Sonya Angelone, owner of a nutrition consulting firm in the San Francisco Bay Area and a spokesperson for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics. However if the unsaturated fat diet really did contribute to heart disease and death, in the study, it could be because of the type of unsaturated fat the participants were eating. The diet in the study ratcheted up the level of omega-6s but did not increase the level of omega-3s, found primarily in fatty fish but also avocados, nuts and their oils. Angelone recommends people reduce saturated fats in their diet and also try to replace them with omega-3 unsaturated fats.

For example, do not swap butter for margarine, as the researchers did in the 1968 Minnesota study. Use liquid oils, and specifically olive oil, walnut oil and avocado oil, which all contain omega-3s, instead of corn oil and seed-based oils, such as sunflower and safflower, which contain omega-6s. "Not all unsaturated fats are the same," Angelone said. Although Angelone agrees with the dietary guidelines to opt for oils instead of saturated fats, it is also important to remember to mix up the oils you use and try to consume olive and nut oils as much as possible.
